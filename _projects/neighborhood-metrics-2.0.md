description: This research project aims to equip urban designers and planners with a set of "socialized" metrics to complement the typical metrics used in transit-oriented development (TOD) projects. An overarching goal was to make it all "bite-sized" and accessibleâ€”to ultimately facilitate conversations with clients and stakeholders about how urban design policies impact equity.
